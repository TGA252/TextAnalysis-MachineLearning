# TextAnalysis-MachineLearning
This project focuses on text analysis and classification using machine learning techniques. 
1. Imports necessary libraries and dependencies for data processing, visualization, and modeling.
2. Defines settings and configurations for output, visualizations, and warnings.
3. Imports the training and testing datasets from CSV files.
4. Preprocesses the text data by removing special characters, single characters, and multiple spaces.
5. Encodes the target labels using label encoding.
6. Performs TF-IDF vectorization on the text data.
7. Splits the data into training and validation sets.
8. Trains a decision tree classifier on the TF-IDF vectors.
9. Evaluates the model's performance on the validation set, including test accuracy and F1-score.
10.Calculates the average F1-score across different classes.
11.Makes predictions on the test set using the trained classifier.
12.Creates a DataFrame with the test example IDs and the corresponding predicted categories.

#Instructions
To replicate the results obtained in this project, follow these steps:

Set up the required environment with the necessary libraries and dependencies.
Ensure that the training and testing datasets are available in the specified file paths.
Run the script file, making sure that all code snippets are executed in the correct order.
Review the model's performance metrics, including test accuracy and F1-score.
Use the generated DataFrame with test example IDs and predicted categories for further analysis or reporting.
